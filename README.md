# RedeemMCMMO
Bukkit Plugin!

This is a fork of RedeemMCMMO. we wanted to use it but it had not been updated since 2013. we have added UUID support and fixed an issue with constant spamming of server console.

This fork was created for the [Arkena Network](https://arkena.cf) and we will try to keep it up to date for as long as possible. or until we switch plugins. but we like this one :D

Tested with latest McMMO and Spigot (1.12.2) as of 30/10/2017
